Autonomous car using neural net and ROS

This project aims at replicating the real-world self-driving car. Implementing ROS, SLAM, vision and deep neural net (CNN),
the 1/10th scaled version of a rally car classifies the type of an obstacle and performs distinct maneuvers for each type
to accomplish the desired motion.
